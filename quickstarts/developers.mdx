# Quick Start for Developers

This guide will help you build and deploy reward functions for your applications using Reward Protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python decorators
- Familiarity with AI model evaluation concepts

## Installation

Install Reward Protocol using pip:

```bash
pip install reward-protocol
```

## Create Your First Reward Function

1. **Define a reward function**:

```python
from reward_protocol import reward_function

@reward_function
def math_accuracy(query: str, response: str) -> float:
    """Evaluate mathematical accuracy of model responses."""
    # Your evaluation logic here
    try:
        # Parse the expected answer from query
        expected = extract_answer(query)
        # Parse the model's answer from response
        actual = extract_answer(response)
        
        return 1.0 if expected == actual else 0.0
    except Exception:
        return 0.0
```

2. **Test locally**:

```python
# Test your reward function
score = math_accuracy(
    query="What is 2 + 2?",
    response="The answer is 4"
)
print(f"Score: {score}")  # Output: Score: 1.0
```

3. **Deploy to Fireworks AI**:

```bash
reward-protocol deploy --target fireworks --function math_accuracy
```
