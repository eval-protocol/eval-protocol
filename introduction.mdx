**Eval Protocol (EP) is the open-source toolkit for building your internal model
leaderboard.**

Building with AI is different. Traditional software is deterministic, but AI
systems are probabilistic. When you have multiple models to choose from—whether
they're different versions of the same model, different providers, or different
configurations—how do you know which one is best for your specific use case?

Today there are so many models to choose from that selecting the right model
based on quality, performance, and cost characteristics is a tough engineering
task.

Write evals that measure what matters to your business, run them consistently
across all your models, and analyze the results to make data-driven decisions
about which model to deploy.
