**Eval Protocol (EP) is the open-source standard and toolkit for practicing Eval-Driven Development.**

Building with AI is different. Traditional software is deterministic, but AI systems are probabilistic. How do you ship new features without causing silent regressions? How do you prove a new prompt is actually better?

The answer is a new engineering discipline: **Eval-Driven Development (EDD)**. It adapts the rigor of Test-Driven Development for the uncertain world of AI. With EDD, you define your AI's desired behavior as a suite of executable tests, creating a safety net that allows you to innovate with confidence.

EP provides a consistent way to write evals, store traces, and analyze results.
