# Reward Protocol

**Author, reproduce, and evaluate reward functions seamlessly on Fireworks, TRL, and your own infrastructure.**

Reward Protocol is a standardized framework for creating, deploying, and evaluating reward functions that assess AI model outputs. It provides a unified interface for building evaluation metrics across different platforms and use cases.

## Why Reward Protocol?

Current reward function development faces several challenges:
- **Fragmentation**: Different platforms use incompatible reward function formats
- **Complexity**: Setting up evaluation pipelines requires significant boilerplate
- **Scalability**: Deploying reward functions across infrastructure is difficult
- **Reproducibility**: Sharing and reproducing evaluation results is challenging

Reward Protocol addresses these issues by providing a standardized, portable framework for reward function development and deployment.

## General Architecture

The Reward Protocol ecosystem consists of several key components:

```

### Core Components

- **Reward Functions**: Python functions decorated with `@reward_function` that evaluate model outputs
- **Protocol Layer**: Standardized interface for defining evaluation criteria and data types
- **Evaluation Engine**: Runtime that executes reward functions against model outputs
- **Deployment Targets**: Various platforms where reward functions can be deployed and scaled
