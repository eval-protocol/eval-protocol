EP is an open [specification](/specification) and [Python
SDK](https://github.com/eval-protocol/python-sdk) that standardizes how
developers author evals for large lanuage models (LLM) applications. It ensures
that writing evals and storing eval results can be reused across model
selection, prompt engineering, and production CI/CD, to fine-tuning for
real-world use cases‚Äîfrom markdown and JSON generation to customer service
agents.

To illustrate, here is a simple example of an evaluation function that evaluates
responses from a [Policy](/specification#policy) based on the number of bullet
points in the response.

```python
# IFEval simple example
```

For a more advanced example, check out our implementation of [ùúè¬≤-bench](#), a
benchmark for evaluating conversational agents in a dual control environment.
