# Eval Protocol

**Eval Protocol is like a universal adapter for AI evaluation — it allows evaluation functions to work seamlessly across any platform, infrastructure, or training pipeline.**

Just as USB-C provides a universal standard for device connectivity, Eval Protocol establishes a universal standard for AI model evaluation, enabling evaluation functions to be written once and deployed anywhere.

## Why Eval Protocol?

Building effective AI evaluation systems today is needlessly complex and fragmented:

- **No Universal Standard**: Every platform requires custom evaluation code, making it difficult to share and reuse evaluation functions
- **Infrastructure Lock-in**: Evaluation logic gets tied to specific platforms, preventing flexible deployment
- **Development Friction**: Setting up evaluation pipelines requires extensive boilerplate and platform-specific knowledge
- **Limited Portability**: Evaluation functions can't easily move between research, training, and production environments

Eval Protocol solves these problems by providing **a single, standardized way to define evaluation functions that work everywhere**.

```

### The Eval Protocol Advantage

**Write Once, Deploy Anywhere**: Define your evaluation logic once using the `@evaluation_function` decorator, then deploy it across any platform or infrastructure without modification.

**Universal Data Types**: Standardized input/output formats ensure your evaluation functions work consistently across different data sources and evaluation contexts.

**Built-in Best Practices**: The protocol includes built-in support for metrics tracking, error handling, and evaluation result structuring.

## Architecture Overview

Eval Protocol uses a **client-server model** where evaluation functions act as specialized evaluation servers that can be called by various AI training and evaluation clients.

### Key Components

- **Evaluation Clients**: Any system that needs to evaluate AI model outputs — training pipelines, research environments, production APIs
- **Protocol Layer**: Standardized communication interface that handles authentication, data serialization, and error management
- **Evaluation Runtime**: Executes evaluation functions in isolated, scalable environments with proper resource management
- **Evaluation Functions**: Your custom evaluation logic, packaged as portable, reusable components
