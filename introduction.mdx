EP is an [open specification](/specification), [Python
SDK](https://github.com/eval-protocol/python-sdk), and pytest wrapper that
provides a standardized way to write evaluations for large language model (LLM)
applications. Start with simple single-turn evals for model selection and prompt
engineering, then scale up to complex multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for
agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP). EP ensures consistent patterns for
writing evals, storing traces, and saving results—enabling you to build
sophisticated agent evaluations that work across real-world scenarios, from
markdown generation tasks to customer service agents with tool calling
capabilities.

For example, here is a simple test function that checks if a model's response
contains **bold** text formatting:

```python test_bold_format.py
@evaluation_test(
    input_dataset=["dataset.jsonl"],
    model=["accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct"],
    rollout_processor=default_single_turn_rollout_processor,
    mode="pointwise",
)
def test_bold_format(row: EvaluationRow) -> EvaluationRow:
    """
    Simple evaluation that checks if the model's response contains bold text.
    """
    
    assistant_response = row.messages[-1].content
    
    # Check if response contains **bold** text
    has_bold = "**" in assistant_response
    
    if has_bold:
        result = EvaluateResult(score=1.0, reason="✅ Response contains bold text")
    else:
        result = EvaluateResult(score=0.0, reason="❌ No bold text found")
    
    row.evaluation_result = result
    return row
```
