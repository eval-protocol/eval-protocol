### Use existing standards

EP relies on existing data models and standards like OpenAI's Chat Completions
API and MCP.

### Great Developer Experience

EP is designed to be easy to use through your IDE as evals are simply pytest
functions. The decorator helps you parameterize your evals, store metadata,
standardize your evals across teams. And the data model has good defaults for
searching through your dataset while flexible enough to support complex
environments.

### Built for Reusability and Growth

EP is designed so that you can use the same evaluation specification and dataset
format across your entire AI development lifecycleâ€”from simple single-turn evals
to building complex, multi-turn RL datasets. This ensures your work remains
compatible and reusable as your needs evolve.

### Fast

Evals can take a long time to run, especially if you have multi-turn agents.
EP's Python SDK is designed to take advantage of concurrency to ensure that you
spend less time waiting for evals to run.

### Supports Multi-turn Agents

EP's Python SDK helps complex multi-turn agent evals by providing a way to
structured but flexible way to author multi-turn rollouts with per-step rewards.

### Saves time throughout your SDLC from local experiments to fine-tuning your own models

Evals are essential for your AI application from day 1 to millions of users.
They are also the single thread that connects your local experiments to
eventualy fine-tuning your own production models. We designed EP to be helpful
in the short-term with tooling, and in the long-term with a standard for evals
so you can build a proper data flywheel.
