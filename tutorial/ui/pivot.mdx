title: Pivot View
---

EP's convenient and locally hosted UI offers a pivot view to help you analyze
your data. If you a familiar with Excel's Pivot Tables, you will feel right at
home. For those who are unfamiliar, pivot tables are an easy way to summarize
and analyze data without having to write formulas or code.

Using a pivot table, you can easily compute aggregate metrics across your data to answer questions like:

- Which model performs best for my application?
- Which prompt performs best for my application?
- How does each model perform on this evaluation and dataset?
- What impact does temperature have on model performance?
- Which tasks in my dataset are the most challenging?
- Is my fine-tuned model outperforming the base model?
- What is the average score across multiple runs?
- Which set of completion parameters yields the best results?

### How to open the pivot view

To know if you are in the pivot view, check that the `Pivot` tab is selected in
the top left corner of the UI.

In the pivot view, you will see a section at the top where you configure your
pivot table.

The pivot table configuration section has five parts:

- **Pivot Rows**: The rows that will be used to group the data.
- **Pivot Columns**: The columns that will be used to group the data.
- **Pivot Values**: The values that will be used to aggregate the data.
- **Pivot Aggregation**: The aggregation function to use for the values.
- **Pivot Filters**: The filters that will be used to filter the data.

### Viewing the data

Once you have configured the pivot table, you can view the data either by chart or table.

#### Chart 

A chart will be automatically rendered based on the pivot table you generate.

You can also click `Export as Image` to download the chart as an image.

#### Table

You can also see the exact computed values in the table view below the chart.
