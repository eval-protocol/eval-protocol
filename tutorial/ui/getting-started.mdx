title: Starting the UI
---

Reviewing model outputs by hand is a key part of evaluating quality. EP makes
this process simple by offering an easy-to-use, locally hosted UI you can set up
in minutes.

To start the UI, simply run the following command and open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

```bash CLI
ep logs
```

<Note>
Ensure the `eval-protocol` package is installed so the `ep` CLI is available.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="uv">

```bash
# Add to your project (installs the `ep` CLI in your environment)
uv add eval-protocol

# Verify installation
uv run ep --version
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pip">

```bash
# Install or upgrade
pip install -U eval-protocol

# Verify installation
ep --version
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Note>

Once you navigate to the UI at http://localhost:8000, you will see a table of
evaluation rows that you can click to inspect.

Whenever you run an `@evaluation_test`—whether from the VSCode Test
Explorer/Debugger or from the CLI via `pytest`—the UI automatically shows
`running` tests and you can watch rollouts live in the chat interface. When a
test finishes, detailed evaluation results appear to the right of the chat.
Tests are stored under a SQLite database on your local device at
`.eval_protocol/logs.db` in the root of your Python project.

To run your tests, you use the `pytest` command directly.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Run with uv virtual environment">

```bash
# Run your tests (UI will reflect live rollouts)
uv run pytest
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Run with your current Python environment">

```bash
# Run your tests (UI will reflect live rollouts)
pytest
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


Once you have your tests running, you can open the UI at
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to monitor rollouts live.
