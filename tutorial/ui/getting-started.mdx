title: Starting the UI
---

Reviewing model outputs by hand is a key part of evaluating quality. EP makes
this process simple by offering an easy-to-use, locally hosted UI you can set up
in minutes.

To start the UI, simply run the following command:

```bash
ep logs
```

<Note>
Ensure the `eval-protocol` package is installed so the `ep` CLI is available.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="uv">

```bash
# Add to your project (installs the `ep` CLI in your environment)
uv add eval-protocol

# Verify installation
uv run ep --version
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pip">

```bash
# Install or upgrade
pip install -U eval-protocol

# Verify installation
ep --version
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Note>

This will start the UI at http://localhost:8000. Once you navigate to the UI,
you will see a table of evaluation rows that you can click to inspect.

Whenever you run an `@evaluation_test`—whether from the VSCode Test
Explorer/Debugger or from the CLI via `pytest`—the UI automatically shows
`running` tests and you can watch rollouts live in the chat interface. When a
test finishes, detailed evaluation results appear to the right of the chat.
Tests are stored under a SQLite database on your local device at
`.eval_protocol/logs.db` in the root of your Python project.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Run with uv">

```bash
# Run your tests (UI will reflect live rollouts)
uv run pytest -q
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Run with pip">

```bash
# Run your tests (UI will reflect live rollouts)
pytest -q
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


`-q` runs `pytest` in quiet mode, reducing console noise so you can focus on the live UI updates. Omit it if you prefer full test output.


Check out this demo of an agent connected to Fireworks Docs MCP server to see
the UI in action while a test is running in VSCode.
