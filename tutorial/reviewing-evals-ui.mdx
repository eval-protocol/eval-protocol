title: Reviewing Evals (UI)

You often need to manually review outputs from the model to assess quality. To
make this easier, EP provides a UI that's easy to set up and use.

To start the UI, simply run the following command:

```bash
eval-protocol logs
```

This will start the UI at http://localhost:8000. Once you navigate to the UI,
you will see a list of previous test runs which you can click on to see the rollout.

Whenever you run an `@evaluation_test`, the UI will automatically show `running`
tests and you can see the rollouts happen live in a convenient chat interface.
Once it's complete, you can view evaluation results to the right of the chat
interface.


Check out this demo of an agent connected to a Discord MCP server to see the UI
in action while running a test in VSCode.
