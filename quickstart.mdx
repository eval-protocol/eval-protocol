# Quick Start

Get started with Eval Protocol by creating your first reward function in just a few minutes.

## Create Your First Reward Function

Here's a simple example of a reward function that evaluates responses based on word count:

```python
from eval_protocol import reward_function
from eval_protocol.models import EvaluateResult, MetricResult
from typing import List, Dict, Any

@reward_function
def word_count_reward(
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    **kwargs: Any
) -> EvaluateResult:
    """Evaluate responses based on word count."""
    
    # Get the last message (the assistant's response)
    response = messages[-1].get("content", "")
    
    # Count words
    word_count = len(response.split())
    
    # Score based on word count (normalize to 0-1)
    score = min(word_count / 50.0, 1.0)  # Max score at 50 words
    
    # Determine success criteria
    success = word_count >= 10
    
    return EvaluateResult(
        score=score,
        reason=f"Response has {word_count} words",
        metrics={
            "word_count": MetricResult(
                score=score,
                success=success,
                reason=f"Word count: {word_count}"
            )
        }
    )
```

## Test Your Reward Function

Test your function with sample data:

```python
# Test with sample messages
test_messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about AI"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AI is a fascinating field that involves creating intelligent systems."}
]

# Evaluate
result = word_count_reward(messages=test_messages)
print(f"Score: {result.score}")
print(f"Reason: {result.reason}")
```

## Preview with Sample Data

Create a JSONL file with sample conversations:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about AI"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "AI refers to systems designed to mimic human intelligence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is machine learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from data."}]}
```

Preview your evaluation using the CLI:

```bash
reward-protocol preview --metrics-folders "word_count=./path/to/metrics" --samples ./samples.jsonl
```

## Run Full Evaluation

For comprehensive evaluations with datasets and configuration:

```bash
reward-protocol run --config-name run_eval.yaml --config-path ./conf
```

## Deploy Your Function

Deploy your reward function for use in production:

```bash
reward-protocol deploy --id my-evaluator --metrics-folders "word_count=./path/to/metrics" --force
```

## Authentication Setup

For Fireworks AI integration, set up your credentials:

```bash
export FIREWORKS_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id"
```
