Eval Protocol is an open standard for AI evaluation that helps developers build
better AI products through robust testing and iteration.

Most AI evaluation frameworks are proprietary or organization-specific, leading to:
- Duplicated evaluation code across teams
- Inconsistent benchmarking standards
- Limited access to proven evaluation methodologies
- Slow iteration cycles without community feedback

Our protocol standardizes AI evaluation, enabling you to:
- Share and reuse evaluation logic across projects
- Benchmark against established baselines
- Iterate faster with community-driven improvements
- Build reproducible evaluation pipelines
- Access evaluation tools used by production AI systems
