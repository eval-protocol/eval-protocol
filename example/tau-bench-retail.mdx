This example demonstrates a multi-turn retail customer service evaluation using 𝜏²-bench environments and MCP tool interactions. For a detailed walkthrough of the concepts behind this evaluation, see our [Multi-Turn Evaluation with User Simulation tutorial](/tutorial/multi-turn-eval-user-simulation).

<Note>
You can find the complete implementation in the Python SDK at `tests/pytest/test_tau_bench_retail.py` and exported as `tau_bench_retail`.
</Note>

## What it does

- Uses multi-turn conversations with MCP tool calling in a retail environment
- Evaluates agents across database state validation and communication quality
- Applies multiplicative scoring where all criteria must pass for full credit
- Runs simulated customer service scenarios with realistic tool interactions

## How it's configured

- `@evaluation_test` uses `MCPGymRolloutProcessor` for multi-turn tool interactions
- Retail dataset entries include evaluation criteria and user simulation contexts
- 𝜏²-bench reward system validates environment state changes and communication quality

## Run it locally

After installing eval-protocol, you can run the benchmark from anywhere:

```bash
pytest --pyargs eval_protocol.benchmarks.test_tau_bench_retail -v \
  --ep-print-summary --ep-summary-json artifacts/tau_bench_retail.json
```

Use `--ep-max-rows=5` for quick testing, or `--ep-reasoning-effort=high` for more thorough evaluation of the stochastic multi-turn interactions.

## Notes

- This evaluation involves multi-turn conversations with tool calling, making it computationally intensive
- Multiple runs recommended due to the stochastic nature of multi-turn user simulation
- Final score uses multiplicative reward where all evaluation criteria must pass for full credit
