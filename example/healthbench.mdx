This example provides a minimal, rubric-driven proxy inspired by HealthBench—for quick sanity checks in clinical-style prompts. It is not a comprehensive or official reimplementation.

<Note>
Code lives in the Python SDK at examples/healthbench. See the test at [examples/healthbench/tests/test_evaluation.py](https://github.com/eval-protocol/python-sdk/blob/main/examples/healthbench/tests/test_evaluation.py).
</Note>

## What it does

- Uses a few in-memory prompts with small rubric lists.
- Extracts simple keyword requirements from rubric criteria (e.g., “hospital”, “urgent”, “hydration”, “rest”).
- Scores 1.0 if the assistant’s response contains any required rubric keywords; otherwise 0.0.

## How it’s configured

- `@evaluation_test` sets a small temperature and token budget.
- Messages are constructed inline; rubrics are mapped by prompt string.

## Run it locally

From the Python SDK repo root:

```bash
pytest -q examples/healthbench/tests/test_evaluation.py \
  --ep-model fireworks_ai/accounts/fireworks/models/gpt-oss-120b
```

## Notes

- This is a minimal proxy to surface safety/quality cues—not a validated clinical benchmark.
- You can expand the rubric list or keyword extraction as needed for your domain.
